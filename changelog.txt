v1.1.1

  * Fixed regressions in the calibration procedure from v1.1.0, please recalibrate after the v1.1.1 upgrade
  * Audience messages can now be edited by keeping the corresponding cell pressed in Global Settings for
    three seconds, sliding horizontally scrolls the text and sliding vertically loops through different
    characters. The maximum message length is 30 characters and trailing spaces will be stripped.
  * Disabled control buttons except for switch 1 and switch 2 when notes are being played on the surface, this
    prevents accidentally going into settings during a live performance
  * Reduced flickering during numeric parameter changes
  * Improvements to changing numeric parameters through sliding
  * Optimized the fonts that are used on the LinnStrument surface

v1.1.0

  * Much reduced latency and jitter, making the LinnStrument wonderful for rapid runs and sharp attacks
  * Improved velocity algorithm that measures actual velocity instead of instantaneous pressure
  * Improved dynamic range and distribution in all three velocity sensitivity settings
  * Added support for 4 presets of global and per-split settings, located at the right edge of the preset section
  * Added support for poly pressure and channel pressure on the Y axis, to access it use the advanced CC configuration
    and slide past number 127
  * Improved middle root note flashing so that it would always occur with the accent color even when disabled in
    the note highlighting configuration
  * Improved debouncing behavior to prevent occasional double note triggers at very low velocities
  * Fix for poly pressure only being sent per-note in ChannelPerNote mode, other modes tied poly pressure to the
    actual MIDI channel, meaning that for instance with ChannelPerRow it was impossible to have per-note poly pressure
    on the same row
  * Fixes to promo animation so that it would not start flickering after a while
  * Added independent layers of lights, which are combined for the final display, allowing external light control
    through MIDI to exist independently of the other lights
  * Change foot pedal behavior to always be in hold mode for Sustain, CC65 and Arpeggiator, and always be in trigger
    mode for Octave Up/Down and Alt Split
  * Fixed octave/transpose display to update when the octave is changed through switches
  * Removed flicker when moving the split point

v1.0.9

  * Added flashing the middle root note when exiting octave/transpose
  * Prevent pitch bends where there are several touches for the same MIDI channel, this allows sliding over semi-tones
    in One Channel mode without changing the pitch of other notes
  * Add support for any bend range between 1-96 through the 5th option down in the Bend Range setting
  * Fix for keeping notes highlighted in the arpeggiator when NotePerChannel is active and the same note is played
    several times on different channels
  * Regression fix for DIN MIDI output not working anymore

v1.0.8

  * Regression fix for scrolling audience messages not working anymore

v1.0.7

  * Noticeable playability improvements
  * Reimplemented velocity and pressure sensitivity modes so that the low settings have more range and all the settings
    have a smooth curve from 0 to 127
  * Low row now behaves exactly the same in slides as the main playing area, including quantization
  * Allow CC faders to be 'played' with multiple fingers similar to the low row
  * Performance optimizations and latency reduction
  * Improved MIDI message output speed
  * Fixed rare situation of switches being inadvertently pressed for a rectangular touch formations

v1.0.6

  * Tweaks to initial touch quantization so that immediate slides feel more natural
  * Tweaks for sensor differences in November models
  * Added indicator in global settings that lights red when the LinnStrument is not calibrated and green when the
    calibration has been performed
  * Added support for sending and retrieving the LinnStrument calibration and settings over serial so that the firmware
    upgrade tool can restore everything after a firmware upgrade

v1.0.5

  * Slow pitch slides now don't have any jumps anymore that were due to the 1mm groove between the cells
  * Improved the Notes Off feature, it now sends CC 120, as well as NoteOff for each note number and each channel, and
    Sustain Off for each channel
  * Changed 'focused cell' logic in One Channel mode, instead of doing pitch-slides and expression on the highest note,
    it's now on the more recent one
  * The global active split color is now displayed in split mode with the LED of the 'Split' switch
  * Double-tapping the 'Split' switch now activates the other split, similar to selecting the split in
    'Per-Split Settings'
  * Pedal and switch operations apart from Alt Split, can now act upon both splits when split mode is active by
    pressing the cell above the Octave Dn setting
  * Fix for foot switch assignments being reversed
  * Fix for low-row bend not properly supporting multiple fingers for pitch-bend jumps anymore
  * Fix for played cell lights sticking if identical notes are played on both splits
  * Fix to reset operation so that calibration data is not lost

v1.0.4

  * Slides transition smoother from one cell to another, based on the pressure contribute of each cell
  * Timbre/Y data changes are stabilized when sliding rapidly over the X axis
  * Active note lights now stay lit when the same note value in a different position is pressed and released
  * Added four additional Y calibration columns, these are needed to obtain precise and predictable timbre changes
    everywhere
  * Introduced easy-to-use one-click firmware updater tool
  * Automatically activate calibration procedure after a firmware update

v1.0.3

  * added low-power mode for iOS bus-power use that is selected by holding down Octave/Transpose at startup
  * added support for independent per-split pitch and light transposition
  * increased octave transposition range to -5 and +5
  * made preset change slider less sensitive in the first three columns to make it easier to just go to previous/next
  * fix for MIDI jacks selection not being persisted correctly across restarts
  * dramatically improved detection of phantom touches, using a new algorithm that relies on calibration
  * added advanced arbitrary CC support by using the 5th option down in the per-split Timbre/Y and Loudness/Z columns

v1.0.2

  * adding progressive smoothing to Y axis value for stability, low pressure has more smoothing
  * relaxed restriction on left and right edge to allow full vibrato past the cell midpoints
  * brought the main volume fader handling in-line with the CC faders, made sure that they're in sync for the sent
    value of MIDI CC 7
  * added full control over the LinnStrument settings through MIDI NRPN messages, see midi.txt for details
  * respond to CC 1-8 MIDI input to change the CC fader values for each split
  * respond to Program Change MIDI input to change the preset values for each split
  * added Windows driver for LinnStrument Programming Port, not signed though so there will be warning when installing
    this driver
  * regression fix where low row wouldn't be smoothly continuous anymore

v1.0.1

  * 20% pressure sensitivity increase, by normalizing to the top instead of to the middle
  * allow for easier pitch slides without triggering new notes
  * improved phantom touch detection to also function during slides
  * changed default low row colors to yellow
  * changed default arpeggiator speed to 16th notes

v1.0.0

  * Initial release
