v1.2.0:

  * Added support for configurable MIDI CC numbers for each split's CC Faders by holding down the
    CC Faders cell in per-split settings
  * Added support for configuring LowRow CC numbers as well as a new Fader mode that is absolute and sticky.
  * Changed split CC Faders to send out over the main channel only, instead of all the playing channels.
  * Enabled playing notes on strummed split
  * Added open strings support for split strumming
  * New approach to pitch hold quantization so that it's more fine-grained and can be faster. It now also
    exponentially corrects based on the movement speed instead of linearly, which feels more natural.
  * Improvements to low power mode to make it consume less, be more robust and slightly more responsive.
  * Added detection for settings corruption that might occur when unplugging right at the moment when
    LinnStrument is storing settings. A global reset will automatically be formed in this case with an
    appropriate warning message.
  * Support for User Firmware Mode, explained in user_firmware_mode.txt

v1.1.3:

  * Pitch hold quantization settings now behave consistently with the rest of the UI but being mutually
    exclusive between medium and fast, and requiring two cells to be pressed for the slow setting.
  * Made incoming MIDI messages on splits with ChannelPerRow mode active only highlight the exact cells that match
    based on the channel information.
  * Fixed bug where settings where not stored after doing a reset through the Global Settings Actions
  * Improved manufacturing test procedure.

v1.1.2

  * Removed delay on touch release so that accidental legato and note de-duplication aren't triggered anymore
  * Allow MIDI CC 22 LED messages to turn a cell off explicitly by sending value 7

v1.1.1

  * Fixed regressions in the calibration procedure from v1.1.0, please recalibrate after the v1.1.1 upgrade
  * New approach to 'all settings' preset handling. Pressing an 'all settings' cell will now load the settings
    that belong to it and holding down that cell for 2 seconds will store the current settings into that preset
    cell. The current state of LinnStrument continues to exist outside of the 'all settings' presets, which have
    now essentially become save locations.
  * Audience messages can now be edited by keeping the corresponding cell pressed in Global Settings for
    three seconds, sliding horizontally scrolls the text and sliding vertically loops through different
    characters. The maximum message length is 30 characters and trailing spaces will be stripped.
  * Note pad 4 in Global Pressure Sensitivity settings now toggles traditional aftertouch-like behavior where the
    pressure only has an effect when a minimum amount of force has already been applied
  * Made low-power mode at boot time persist across power cycles
  * Added three different pitch quantize hold speeds, accessible through note pads 3 and 4 form the top in the
    Per Split Pitch/X settings. When note pad 3 is active, quantize hold speed is medium; when note pad 4 is
    also active, it's slow; when only note pad 4 is active, it's fast and when none are active, quantize hold is
    turned off.
  * Moved the hidden Reset On Release option from note pad 4 to note pad 5 in Per Split Pitch/X.
  * Low-power mode can now be turned on/off through note pad 3 in the Global MIDI I/O settings (above MIDI Jacks)
  * Fixed split select on preset and volume screen intervening with the actual settings.
  * Made CC faders and Volume fader more reliable on very soft touches.
  * Disabled control buttons except for switch 1 and switch 2 when notes are being played on the surface, this
    prevents accidentally going into settings during a live performance
  * When pressing down two fingers in the same column and sliding with a third finger on the same row as one of those
    two pressed, the pitch sliding didn't work well. This is fixed.
  * Reduced flickering during numeric parameter changes
  * Improvements to changing numeric parameters through sliding
  * Optimized the fonts that are used on the LinnStrument surface
  * Quantize hold has been very slightly sped up
  * Blink the middle root note when the octave is changed through switches while playing
  * The performance display is always updated when octaves are changed through switches since some cells might fall
    out of MIDI note range and be blank
  * Fix for played note light getting stuck when switch octaves while cells are pressed

v1.1.0

  * Much reduced latency and jitter, making the LinnStrument wonderful for rapid runs and sharp attacks
  * Improved velocity algorithm that measures actual velocity instead of instantaneous pressure
  * Improved dynamic range and distribution in all three velocity sensitivity settings
  * Added support for 4 presets of global and per-split settings, located at the right edge of the preset section
  * Added support for poly pressure and channel pressure on the Y axis, to access it use the advanced CC configuration
    and slide past number 127
  * Improved middle root note flashing so that it would always occur with the accent color even when disabled in
    the note highlighting configuration
  * Improved debouncing behavior to prevent occasional double note triggers at very low velocities
  * Fix for poly pressure only being sent per-note in ChannelPerNote mode, other modes tied poly pressure to the
    actual MIDI channel, meaning that for instance with ChannelPerRow it was impossible to have per-note poly pressure
    on the same row
  * Fixes to promo animation so that it would not start flickering after a while
  * Added independent layers of lights, which are combined for the final display, allowing external light control
    through MIDI to exist independently of the other lights
  * Change foot pedal behavior to always be in hold mode for Sustain, CC65 and Arpeggiator, and always be in trigger
    mode for Octave Up/Down and Alt Split
  * Fixed octave/transpose display to update when the octave is changed through switches
  * Removed flicker when moving the split point

v1.0.9

  * Added flashing the middle root note when exiting octave/transpose
  * Prevent pitch bends where there are several touches for the same MIDI channel, this allows sliding over semi-tones
    in One Channel mode without changing the pitch of other notes
  * Add support for any bend range between 1-96 through the 5th option down in the Bend Range setting
  * Fix for keeping notes highlighted in the arpeggiator when NotePerChannel is active and the same note is played
    several times on different channels
  * Regression fix for DIN MIDI output not working anymore

v1.0.8

  * Regression fix for scrolling audience messages not working anymore

v1.0.7

  * Noticeable playability improvements
  * Reimplemented velocity and pressure sensitivity modes so that the low settings have more range and all the settings
    have a smooth curve from 0 to 127
  * Low row now behaves exactly the same in slides as the main playing area, including quantization
  * Allow CC faders to be 'played' with multiple fingers similar to the low row
  * Performance optimizations and latency reduction
  * Improved MIDI message output speed
  * Fixed rare situation of switches being inadvertently pressed for a rectangular touch formations

v1.0.6

  * Tweaks to initial touch quantization so that immediate slides feel more natural
  * Tweaks for sensor differences in November models
  * Added indicator in global settings that lights red when the LinnStrument is not calibrated and green when the
    calibration has been performed
  * Added support for sending and retrieving the LinnStrument calibration and settings over serial so that the firmware
    upgrade tool can restore everything after a firmware upgrade

v1.0.5

  * Slow pitch slides now don't have any jumps anymore that were due to the 1mm groove between the cells
  * Improved the Notes Off feature, it now sends CC 120, as well as NoteOff for each note number and each channel, and
    Sustain Off for each channel
  * Changed 'focused cell' logic in One Channel mode, instead of doing pitch-slides and expression on the highest note,
    it's now on the more recent one
  * The global active split color is now displayed in split mode with the LED of the 'Split' switch
  * Double-tapping the 'Split' switch now activates the other split, similar to selecting the split in
    'Per-Split Settings'
  * Pedal and switch operations apart from Alt Split, can now act upon both splits when split mode is active by
    pressing the cell above the Octave Dn setting
  * Fix for foot switch assignments being reversed
  * Fix for low-row bend not properly supporting multiple fingers for pitch-bend jumps anymore
  * Fix for played cell lights sticking if identical notes are played on both splits
  * Fix to reset operation so that calibration data is not lost

v1.0.4

  * Slides transition smoother from one cell to another, based on the pressure contribute of each cell
  * Timbre/Y data changes are stabilized when sliding rapidly over the X axis
  * Active note lights now stay lit when the same note value in a different position is pressed and released
  * Added four additional Y calibration columns, these are needed to obtain precise and predictable timbre changes
    everywhere
  * Introduced easy-to-use one-click firmware updater tool
  * Automatically activate calibration procedure after a firmware update

v1.0.3

  * added low-power mode for iOS bus-power use that is selected by holding down Octave/Transpose at startup
  * added support for independent per-split pitch and light transposition
  * increased octave transposition range to -5 and +5
  * made preset change slider less sensitive in the first three columns to make it easier to just go to previous/next
  * fix for MIDI jacks selection not being persisted correctly across restarts
  * dramatically improved detection of phantom touches, using a new algorithm that relies on calibration
  * added advanced arbitrary CC support by using the 5th option down in the per-split Timbre/Y and Loudness/Z columns

v1.0.2

  * adding progressive smoothing to Y axis value for stability, low pressure has more smoothing
  * relaxed restriction on left and right edge to allow full vibrato past the cell midpoints
  * brought the main volume fader handling in-line with the CC faders, made sure that they're in sync for the sent
    value of MIDI CC 7
  * added full control over the LinnStrument settings through MIDI NRPN messages, see midi.txt for details
  * respond to CC 1-8 MIDI input to change the CC fader values for each split
  * respond to Program Change MIDI input to change the preset values for each split
  * added Windows driver for LinnStrument Programming Port, not signed though so there will be warning when installing
    this driver
  * regression fix where low row wouldn't be smoothly continuous anymore

v1.0.1

  * 20% pressure sensitivity increase, by normalizing to the top instead of to the middle
  * allow for easier pitch slides without triggering new notes
  * improved phantom touch detection to also function during slides
  * changed default low row colors to yellow
  * changed default arpeggiator speed to 16th notes

v1.0.0

  * Initial release
