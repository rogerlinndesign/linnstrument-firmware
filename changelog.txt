v1.1.0

  * Much reduced latency and jitter, making the LinnStrument wonderful for rapid runs and sharp attacks
  * Improved velocity algorithm that measures actual velocity instead of instantaneous pressure
  * Improved dynamic range and distribution in all three velocity sensitivity settings
  * Added support for 4 presets of global and per-split settings, located at the right edge of the preset section
  * Added support for poly pressure and channel pressure on the Y axis, to access it use the advanced CC configuration
    and slide past number 127
  * Improved middle root note flashing so that it would always occur with the accent color even when disabled in
    the note highlighting configuration
  * Improved debouncing behavior to prevent occasional double note triggers at very low velocities
  * Fix for poly pressure only being sent per-note in ChannelPerNote mode, other modes tied poly pressure to the
    actual MIDI channel, meaning that for instance with ChannelPerRow it was impossible to have per-note poly pressure
    on the same row
  * Fixes to promo animation so that it would not start flickering after a while
  * Added independent layers of lights, which are combined for the final display, allowing external light control
    through MIDI to exist independently of the other lights
  * Removed flicker when moving the split point

v1.0.9

  * Added flashing the middle root note when exiting octave/transpose
  * Prevent pitch bends where there are several touches for the same MIDI channel, this allows sliding over semi-tones
    in One Channel mode without changing the pitch of other notes
  * Add support for any bend range between 1-96 through the 5th option down in the Bend Range setting
  * Fix for keeping notes highlighted in the arpeggiator when NotePerChannel is active and the same note is played
    several times on different channels
  * Regression fix for DIN MIDI output not working anymore

v1.0.8

  * Regression fix for scrolling audience messages not working anymore

v1.0.7

  * Noticeable playability improvements
  * Reimplemented velocity and pressure sensitivity modes so that the low settings have more range and all the settings
    have a smooth curve from 0 to 127
  * Low row now behaves exactly the same in slides as the main playing area, including quantization
  * Allow CC faders to be 'played' with multiple fingers similar to the low row
  * Performance optimizations and latency reduction
  * Improved MIDI message output speed
  * Fixed rare situation of switches being inadvertently pressed for a rectangular touch formations

v1.0.6

  * Tweaks to initial touch quantization so that immediate slides feel more natural
  * Tweaks for sensor differences in November models
  * Added indicator in global settings that lights red when the LinnStrument is not calibrated and green when the
    calibration has been performed
  * Added support for sending and retrieving the LinnStrument calibration and settings over serial so that the firmware
    upgrade tool can restore everything after a firmware upgrade

v1.0.5

  * Slow pitch slides now don't have any jumps anymore that were due to the 1mm groove between the cells
  * Improved the Notes Off feature, it now sends CC 120, as well as NoteOff for each note number and each channel, and
    Sustain Off for each channel
  * Changed 'focused cell' logic in One Channel mode, instead of doing pitch-slides and expression on the highest note,
    it's now on the more recent one
  * The global active split color is now displayed in split mode with the LED of the 'Split' switch
  * Double-tapping the 'Split' switch now activates the other split, similar to selecting the split in
    'Per-Split Settings'
  * Pedal and switch operations apart from Alt Split, can now act upon both splits when split mode is active by
    pressing the cell above the Octave Dn setting
  * Fix for foot switch assignments being reversed
  * Fix for low-row bend not properly supporting multiple fingers for pitch-bend jumps anymore
  * Fix for played cell lights sticking if identical notes are played on both splits
  * Fix to reset operation so that calibration data is not lost

v1.0.4

  * Slides transition smoother from one cell to another, based on the pressure contribute of each cell
  * Timbre/Y data changes are stabilized when sliding rapidly over the X axis
  * Active note lights now stay lit when the same note value in a different position is pressed and released
  * Added four additional Y calibration columns, these are needed to obtain precise and predictable timbre changes
    everywhere
  * Introduced easy-to-use one-click firmware updater tool
  * Automatically activate calibration procedure after a firmware update

v1.0.3

  * added low-power mode for iOS bus-power use that is selected by holding down Octave/Transpose at startup
  * added support for independent per-split pitch and light transposition
  * increased octave transposition range to -5 and +5
  * made preset change slider less sensitive in the first three columns to make it easier to just go to previous/next
  * fix for MIDI jacks selection not being persisted correctly across restarts
  * dramatically improved detection of phantom touches, using a new algorithm that relies on calibration
  * added advanced arbitrary CC support by using the 5th option down in the per-split Timbre/Y and Loudness/Z columns

v1.0.2

  * adding progressive smoothing to Y axis value for stability, low pressure has more smoothing
  * relaxed restriction on left and right edge to allow full vibrato past the cell midpoints
  * brought the main volume fader handling in-line with the CC faders, made sure that they're in sync for the sent
    value of MIDI CC 7
  * added full control over the LinnStrument settings through MIDI NRPN messages, see midi.txt for details
  * respond to CC 1-8 MIDI input to change the CC fader values for each split
  * respond to Program Change MIDI input to change the preset values for each split
  * added Windows driver for LinnStrument Programming Port, not signed though so there will be warning when installing
    this driver
  * regression fix where low row wouldn't be smoothly continuous anymore

v1.0.1

  * 20% pressure sensitivity increase, by normalizing to the top instead of to the middle
  * allow for easier pitch slides without triggering new notes
  * improved phantom touch detection to also function during slides
  * changed default low row colors to yellow
  * changed default arpeggiator speed to 16th notes

v1.0.0

  * Initial release
