v1.0.4

  * Slides transition smoother from one cell to another, based on the pressure contribute of each cell
  * Timbre/Y data changes are stabilized when sliding rapidly over the X axis
  * Active note lights now stay lit when the same note value in a different position is pressed and released
  * Added four additional Y calibration columns, these are needed to obtain precise and predictable timbre changes everywhere
  * Introduced easy-to-use one-click firmware updater tool

v1.0.3

  * added low-power mode for iOS bus-power use that is selected by holding down Octave/Transpose at startup
  * added support for independent per-split pitch and light transposition
  * increased octave transposition range to -5 and +5
  * made preset change slider less sensitive in the first three columns to make it easier to just go to previous/next
  * fix for MIDI jacks selection not being persisted correctly across restarts
  * dramatically improved detection of phantom touches, using a new algorithm that relies on calibration
  * added advanced arbitrary CC support by using the 5th option down in the per-split Timbre/Y and Loudness/Z columns

v1.0.2

  * adding progressive smoothing to Y axis value for stability, low pressure has more smoothing
  * relaxed restriction on left and right edge to allow full vibrato past the cell midpoints
  * brought the main volume fader handling in-line with the CC faders, made sure that they're in sync for the sent value of MIDI CC 7
  * added full control over the LinnStrument settings through MIDI NRPN messages, see midi.txt for details
  * respond to CC 1-8 MIDI input to change the CC fader values for each split
  * respond to Program Change MIDI input to change the preset values for each split
  * added Windows driver for LinnStrument Programming Port, not signed though so there will be warning when installing this driver
  * regression fix where low row wouldn't be smoothly continuous anymore

v1.0.1

  * 20% pressure sensitivity increase, by normalizing to the top instead of to the middle
  * allow for easier pitch slides without triggering new notes
  * improved phantom touch detection to also function during slides
  * changed default low row colors to yellow
  * changed default arpeggiator speed to 16th notes

v1.0.0

  * Initial release
