***************************************************************************************************
Macros used for debugging output.  Note that you need to use two parenthesis to enclose the
argument - this allows debug code to be completely removed when the DEBUG_ENABLED is not defined.

Examples:

      DEBUGPRINT((-1,"This is ALWAYS printed"));
      DEBUGPRINT((0,"This is printed for debugLevel >= 0"));
      DEBUGPRINT((1,"This is printed for debugLevel >= 1"));

Normally, debug output is enabled but selectively controlled with debugLevel. Higher debugLevel
values enable more and more debugging output. Typically, level 0 is used for things that you're
currently debugging. After debugging something, either remove them or move them to higher levels.
